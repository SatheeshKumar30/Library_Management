# Library Management..!

The believe that each member will obtain an identification card that may be used to issue a library book, a fine fee, etc. If a member of the library wants to take a book, the library authority's book would check all the particulars of the book and the student's records and store them in the library database. A lot of human interference can be removed in the case of book retrieval.

Module Description:
